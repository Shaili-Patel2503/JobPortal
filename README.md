Job Board Application - Introduction
A Job Board Application is a full-stack web application designed to aggregate job postings from platforms like Naukri.com or LinkedIn Jobs and present them in an interactive UI.

Pagination or infinite scrolling for better navigation.
Automatic data refresh every 24 hours to keep job listings up-to-date.
Detailed job page with an "Apply" button for seamless user experience.
Minimalistic and clean UI for enhanced usability.
